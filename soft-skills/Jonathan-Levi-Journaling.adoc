=== Section 1: Getting Started

*Introduction & About Your Instructor*

Greetings and welcome to this course on journalling mastery. My name is Jonathan Levy, and I'm so excited to be your guide through this course. For those of you who don't know me, I'm a serial entrepreneur, published author and award winning podcast in the Personal Development Space. My courses on everything from accelerated learning and productivity to lifestyle design and physical health have garnered hundreds of thousands of students all over the world. And it is my personal mission to empower and improve the lives of over one million people worldwide. Which brings us to the topic of today's course, journaling. If you are here, it's most likely because you've heard about the powerful benefits that journaling can bring to your life, your career and your growth, and you want to know how to get started or enrich your existing practice. Well, first off, let me say good for you. And yes, you have come to the right place. You see, like you, I wasn't always a journaling aficionado. In fact, despite the fact that journaling came up time and time again, whether in the high level mastermind's I attended or in podcast conversations with some of the world's most successful people, I was really slow to actually pick it up. Maybe it was the connotations I had around journaling, or perhaps I just didn't think something so seemingly simple could actually offer me much today. However, I realized that I simply didn't understand what I was missing. But all of that changed in the beginning of twenty eighteen when my friend, psychologist Dr. Benjamin Hardy, convinced me to give journalling a try. *According to him, journaling was the number one most impactful personal development practice in his toolkit, propelling him personally and professionally at breakneck speed*. And since Benjamin is someone I deeply, deeply admire personally and professionally, I decided to give it a try. So I began experimenting with all different types of journaling exercises. I began asking podcast guests for their favorite prompts. I look back on notes from some of the seminars and mastermind's that attended over the years, and I tried some of those prompts too. Little by little, I got into the swing of things and even developed some of my own tricks for getting the most out of my budding journaling practice. And before I knew it, I was experiencing some truly life changing results *in very little time at all. I felt more grounded, more aligned, happier and more in control. I had a better sense of clarity. I was able to problem solve in my businesses and my relationships and much, much more*. Since then, I've expanded my journaling practice even further to include a myriad of different exercises, tips, tactics and techniques. So many so in fact, that I felt compelled to create this course and share them with the world in the hopes that you too can reap the many benefits of journaling in your own life as I have. So that's a little bit about me and why I've created this course for you. Up next, let's set expectations and quickly go over what exactly you'll learn in this course.

*What You’ll Learn In This Course*

Before we dive in too deep, I want to take a quick moment to give you an overview of what you're going to learn in this course, setting expectations and helping you ensure that you've come to the right place. Now, this might seem like filler, but as an expert in accelerated learning, I can assure you that it's anything but understanding what you're going to learn, in what order and why is an important and foundational step towards learning success. So by giving you a heads up of what you can expect and when we build excitement, motivation and anticipation, all of which are crucial if you're going to complete this course and actually implement it. But that's not the only thing we're going to do to guarantee your success. You see throughout the rest of this section, we're going to be doing a little bit more foundational work and learn why journaling is so valuable again to help you get motivated, energized and committed. So, yeah, anything but fluff with you energized and aligned, we're then going to dive right in to doing. We'll get you set up with the right journal for you. Talk a little bit about how to format it and then get you implementing as soon as possible by writing your very first journal entry with the foundations out of the way and a little experience under our belts will head into Section two, where you'll learn a bunch of very powerful daily journaling exercises, each with a different purpose and set of benefits. Having a whole litany of daily exercises will allow you to pick and choose the right exercises for the right scenarios, in addition to mixing it up and keeping things interesting. This ultimately is one of the things that will determine whether or not you stick with the journaling habit and reap the benefits it has to offer. Once you've picked up the daily exercises, we're going to be rolling out the big guns in Section three, the powerful special purpose exercises that you can use for unique situations or challenges that you may face, though you won't do these types of exercises every single day, you'll be happy to have them in your toolkit when you need them. In fact, I would say that a large part of the value of this course lies in mastering each one of these exercises. Up next, with even more tools in our toolkit, we'll head on over to Section four, where you'll learn how to solidify the journaling habit. You'll learn the details when to journal how much and how to make the habit stick. You'll learn some behavioral change techniques for integrating this practice into your life and how to get back on track when you fall off the wagon. And finally, with all that learning behind us, we'll close out the course with Section five, which covers success and expansion moving forward. Throughout the course, you'll be given prompts and assignments to reinforce your learning and try things out as you go. Don't skip these. I know how tempting it can be to sit back and passively consume the course in one sitting, but that's no way to actually learn and grow. And let's face it, if you just wanted to be entertained, you'd be watching Netflix right now instead of watching me. So make sure to do those prompts so you can reap the full benefits of everything this course has to offer. By the way, for your convenience, we've created a handy PDF syllabus for this course which aggregates all of the resources, assignments and links that you'll need to complete the course. The downloadable file is attached to this lecture, so make sure to download it now before moving on to the next lecture. And there you have it. A nice overview of everything you have to look forward to in this course. If all of that sounds good to you, then go ahead and join me in the next lecture where we'll build up our motivation and excitement even further by discussing the very many truly surprising benefits of journaling.

*Why Journaling Is So Valuable*

As some of you may know, for over five years, I was the proud host of the award winning Super Human Academy podcast where I had the great honor and privilege of interviewing over 300 of the world's top superhumans, business leaders, athletes and many, many more, as you can imagine throughout that journey. I learned a ton of techniques, skills and strategies for improving performance, health and happiness. In fact, all the way down to the three 100th episode, I was still hearing new things to try out. And yet over the years, I couldn't help but notice that there were a few habits that kept coming up time and time again, practices or tools that seemed disproportionately popular among these high performing individuals. *You probably won't be surprised to hear that one of them was meditation*. Indeed, while meditation seems like such a silly, simple activity, sitting still and focusing on one thing, it turns out that there are mountains of scientific literature supporting its many, many benefits for your health, well-being, cognition and happiness. Indeed, these days there isn't a doctor or self-help guru alive who would deny that meditation is a massively effective tool for self-improvement, health and happiness. But what would you say if I told you that journalling, the simple act of writing words on a page that nobody else will ever see is similarly supported by the medical literature or that it has an equally long laundry list of benefits? You might be surprised, but it's true. Now, if you're like me, you're probably here to gain one or two specific benefits, be it more focus and success in your career that are recollection of your life's events or more happiness. And yes, you're going to get all of that, too. But as it turns out, there is so much more that journaling has to offer. In fact, in the words of New York Times writer Hayley Feiglin, *scientific studies have shown it to be essentially a panacea for modern life*.

Do I have your attention? Great. Now let's get specific. Did you know, for example, that journaling has been scientifically proven *to boost your immune system and help injuries heal faster, or that it has been studied as an effective treatment for stress, anxiety and depression*? But that's not all. In fact, studies have even found that *journaling can lead to better sleep, more self-confidence improves working memory and even higher I.Q*.. It sounds insane, but it's true if you're curious. I've included links to a small subset of articles and studies in the PDF syllabus for you to read more. *So, yes, journaling will help you achieve your goals faster, be more emotionally grounded and happy in your daily life and help you feel more in control*. And all of this simply by putting pen to paper for a few minutes a day. Now, you might be wondering if you're like me, how can this possibly be, after all, like meditation? Journaling is such a seemingly simple thing. Well, scientists and psychologists have quite a bit to say about this. They cite the importance of things like unpacking emotional trauma, the calming effect of the slowing down and writing the value of self-expression and the opportunity to rewrite painful memories in a new light. This all makes a lot of sense, and I encourage you to dive deeper into the scientific literature that I've shared. If you'd like to learn more about the actual neuroscience behind how all this works. But for now, I'd like to share with you from my own personal experience why I think journaling packs such a punch. Let me start by asking you, *when was the last time you sat down uninterrupted and thought your way through a problem with zero distractions*? Chances are with so much noise and so many things vying for our attention these days. It's been a while since you dedicated time to just thinking. And even if you did, it's likely that you'd get distracted, sidetracked or go in circles. *Cognitive scientists claim that up to 98 percent of our daily thoughts are the same repeats. And I bet you've experienced this for yourself. This is because our brains are really good at thinking about ideas, problems and obstacles. But as the saying goes, the same type of thinking that got you into the problem is incapable of getting you out*. And so we ruminate. We go in circles thinking about the things we want to do or change or create and get stuck at the reasons why we can't. And round and round and round we go. Only when we're able to fully focus, when we have some external influence, like a conversation with a friend or a therapist, for example. Do we break through to the solutions? Enter journaling. *First of all*, journaling gives you a tangible thing to focus on as you do your uninterrupted thinking. In this way, it serves the same purpose as the mantra or your breath during meditation. It's a tool to keep you engaged. What's more, the act of writing things down changes your thinking, slowing you down, accessing different parts of the brain, and allowing you to push through the same old roadblocks and circles. Whereas you could easily go about thinking the same thoughts over and over on repeat, day in and day out. It's harder to ignore a thought pattern when it's staring back at you on a piece of paper. Add to this the fact that journaling gives you a record of your life and your thoughts that you can go back and look at any time you wish. This allows you to gain perspective on what you were feeling and thinking and when giving you a tremendous ability to review and make changes in your life. As such, journaling takes so much of the guesswork out of your personal growth, holding you accountable to your goals and aspirations while simultaneously offering you a record of what worked and what didn't. But these are truly just a few of the many, many things that make journaling so powerful and so valuable. I'm sure you'll discover many, many more as we progress throughout the course. And I'd rather we spend our time doing just that. So let's not delay any further. Join me in the next lecture where we'll figure out the right journaling medium for you. OK, everyone, before. We move on to the next section, I just want to let you know that pretty soon Udemy is going to ask you if you would like to leave a review and if you could just take a quick second and go ahead and leave us a review. We would really appreciate it because it boosts our credibility, helps us bring in more students, which helps us build even better courses. And by the way, if you've had anything less than an absolutely perfect experience, then just go ahead and send us a message and we'll actually go ahead and improve that part of the course for you anyway. We really, really appreciate it. And let's move on.

*How To Choose The Right Format & Journal For You*

Before we can start journaling, we need to figure out *where* you'll be doing all this magical, life changing writing on this, there are a lot of different schools of thought and opinions from those who believe that paper is the only way to go to tech wizards who use the latest notetaking, technology and searchingly index and tag every scrap they write and more. One business luminary I greatly admire, Derek Sivers, even suggested to me that I use old school plain text files to avoid the risk of software going obsolete or data getting erased. Other guests on my podcast have developed their own readymade journals, such as the Freedom Journal, the Five Minute Journal and so on. All this is to say that there is no one perfect solution for everybody in this lecture. However, we're going to unpack the various pros and cons of each medium, after which I will share with you my own recommendations for the perfect journal. *First, let's tackle the elephant in the room, digital versus paper*. Look, I get it. Most of us are very out of shape when it comes to long form handwriting, and we type much faster, too. And yes, there is something very appealing about having your notes be searchable. You could, for example, search for someone's name and instantly find everything you've ever written about them with ease. You could add links, snippets, pictures and more. What's more, if you use a cloud synchronised service like Evernote, you gain the ability to write notes from anywhere with any device, whether or not you remember to pack your journal. There are even dedicated journaling apps like Day One, which feature data protection, automated nostalgic reminders, cross platform synchronization and a beautiful design made just for journaling. All of that is very tempting, and you'll be relieved to know that some of the studies I shared earlier actually did study the benefits of digital journaling. And yet, let me ask you point blank, do you really want to spend more time in front of screens with Bings, Bopp's and notifications distracting you? Do you really want your journaling practice to be about maximum efficiency, geeky searches and words per minute? Or like so many journaling aficionados, are you looking for something different from your day to day work? Journaling by paper allows you to step away from screens and keyboards, something most modern humans are sorely lacking. And it allows you to slow down, relax and think through things before you commit them to paper. And perhaps more importantly, writing on plain old paper protects you from the distractions and temptations that come when you open any digital device. It's for this reason I and most of the journaling die hards that I know stick to paper journaling exclusively. But what about all the extra benefits of going digital? Well, I have good news for you. You don't have to lose out on them. You could, for example, pick up a rocket ebook, Everlast, an eco friendly, reusable notebook that allows you to write by hand and easily scan into any service of your choosing. Or if you want to keep a physical copy and the pleasure of putting pen to paper, you could photograph and upload copies of your plain old notebook. Best of all, many modern notetaking apps like Evernote will actually perform optical character recognition, making your handwriting searchable just like typed text. It even works in other languages and cursive for some of those languages. Personally, I've never felt the need to scan my journal pages. It's easy enough for me to flip back through the pages and find what I'm looking for. But for those of you who care about search ability, this is a great way to have your cake and eat it, too. Up next, let's talk a bit about the types of journals. More specifically, readymade versus blank. Unless you're new to personal development, you've probably seen a lot of experts and thought leaders, folks like Michael Hyatt and Johnny Domus, promoting their own version of ready made journals. These journals feature Easy Done for You Prompts for you to fill out. They take all of the guesswork out of journaling where all you need to do is show up and do what you're told. And this is just one of the reasons why I don't like them. Besides being five to 10 times more expensive than blank journals, I find them to be unnecessarily restrictive. In my opinion, they waste 60 percent of the space on a page with quotes and prompts, taking away the opportunity for you to write freely and independently. In doing so, I believe that they take away a lot of the value from journaling, turning it from a quiet, introspective process into a glorified form filling. What's more, I believe that one of the most important skills for anyone who journals is to know when to use which tool, technique or prompt based on where you are and what you're trying to achieve. Something that's impossible with a gun for you. Journal my recommendation. Look up one of these journals online, combine some of their. With the ones you'll learn in this course and work them into the mix whenever you see fit. All right. So by now, I hope that you are on board for starting out with a plain old blank journal, though, of course, it's fine if you're going to try something different. But within paper journals, which one should you choose? There are so many shapes, sizes, types and colors. Well, on this, allow me to share some of the benefit from my own trial and error. First off, I recommend that you choose a lined notebook unless you are someone who particularly enjoys drawing and wants to add that into the mix. Having lines keeps you from making a mess on the page. And since most of what we're going to be doing is writing that we want to be able to read back later, I'd lead in that direction. Up next, I want to recommend that you choose a hardbound notebook rather than a spiral bound or paperback. The reason for this is simple. You're going to be taking your journal with you all kinds of places. You'll be throwing it in your work bag, tossing it in with your carry on for vacation and even sitting outside with it. The last thing that you want is for it to get ripped or for the spirals to get all bent out of whack. What's more, you're going to want to keep your journal stored safely in a box or shelf for years. And for that reason, a hardcover is going to protect your precious writing best. Naturally, it's up to you whether you choose something fancy, like leather or just something basic. All right. Now, what about size? Well, here we have to be pragmatic. Personally, I like having the largest possible notebook so that no matter how much I want to write on a given day, I rarely spill over onto a second page. The obsessive organizer in me loves the idea of having one page per day with clean divisions. With that said, I suggest that you make your own decision based on how you store and move your personal belongings. If you're a gal who likes to take a small purse or handbag and sit at a cafe, you'll probably want a smaller journal that fits in your favorite handbag. If you're like me and always lug a full sized backpack everywhere you go, then pick up the biggest notebook you can find. And if you don't plan on taking your journal with you too frequently except for vacations, then go as big as you like. Now let's talk about a number of pages. I do suggest that you choose a journal with at least 80 sheets, which translates to 160 pages. That way, if you fill out one page almost every day, your journal will last roughly half a year, making it easy to know which journals correspond to which years over your life. One last note and this one I'm sharing from experience. Before you commit to a journal type, make sure it's something that you'll be able to replace if and when you pick up the habit of journaling, you're going to be going through a lot of journals and you don't want to end up in a situation where you can't get another of the exact journal you've become used to easily. I know this all too well. I started my practice with some very nice journals that were made exclusively for a high level mastermind I used to attend and when I stopped attending due to covid-19, I was no longer able to get this exact model notebook. Now, maybe you're not as nit picky as I am, but it's still a bummer to have half of my journals one size and the rest another. OK, that was a lot of information to take in. And there's still the matter of which brands where to buy, blah, blah, blah. You might be thinking. Jonathan, just tell me which one to get. Well, as I mentioned earlier, I personally had a lot of difficulty replacing the journal that I fell in love with. In fact, I discovered that it was actually a custom size that could only be purchased in bulk. So to make it easier for all of you, I've actually gone ahead and bulk ordered a ton of these journals and had them custom designed and printed for this course. Now, before you go thinking that this is just another one of those readymade journals I talked about that waste 60 percent of their space with quotes and filler. Let me assure you, this journal is 100 percent filter free, leaving you the full freedom to express yourself without limits. The Journal does feature a beautifully designed faux leather cover and elastic privacy closure, a folder in the back and a satin bookmark as well as eighty lined sheets. What's more, right on the inside cover, we have printed a full color summary of every exercise that you're going to learn in this course to help jog your memory and keep your journaling practice fresh and diverse. Perhaps best of all, unlike many other ready-Made journals, it won't cost you forty dollars plus now supplies are limited. So if you'd like to pick up your very own journal while those supplies last, go ahead and visit Superhuman Academy Dotcom Journal today. So there you have it. Throughout this lecture, we've talked about digital versus paper made journals versus free. And even size and format of the journal, now it's time for you to pick up or set up your journal, whether digital or paper, because very soon you're going to crack it open and start actually journaling.

=== Section 2: Daily Journaling Exercises

*Becoming Your Life’s Historian*

Hey there and welcome back. I hope that your first journaling session was a rewarding and relaxing experience and that you are already starting to see how this is going to be a really transformative part of your personal development. In this second section of the course, we're going to be delving into a myriad of different daily exercises that you can choose from any time you sit down to journal. One important note, when I say daily, I don't mean that you need to do all of them every day or even that you need to do a single one of them every day by daily exercises. I merely mean that these are the types of exercises that you can choose from on any given day, regardless of what's going on in your life without any outside impetus. Personally, I like to mix and match different daily exercises to keep things interesting and reap the benefits of each of them. This is because, as you'll see, each of these exercises serves a different purpose and has unique benefits. And some days some exercises will feel more valuable than others. But more on that later. For now, let's start with what is perhaps the most foundational journaling exercise of all and the one most people are familiar with *becoming your life's historian*. As the title suggests, this exercise is simply describing the events of your life in the same way a historian would. You can do this on the macro level, sharing big trends such as new jobs or relationships, or at the micro level documenting daily progress with various goals, projects or journeys in life. Now, you might be wondering why would I want to document my life's events? After all, we all travel around with cameras in our pockets and have detailed histories of every chat and email we send out. But becoming the historian of your life is so much more than that. *First of all*, it documents your emotional state as you progress through life. This alone has numerous benefits. For one, it adds clarity and certainty to something that humans are inherently bad at remembering our emotions. You might think, for example, that a particular period in your life was incredibly happy only to look back and realize that most days were actually pretty mundane. Having this information also makes it much easier to course correct. Imagine, for example, if you find yourself being unhappy for an extended period of time in the future, you can simply flip back through your journal in search of happier times and determine exactly what was different. Who are you spending your time with? What were you working on? What habits were you engaged in? From experience, I can tell you that there's a lot of value to be had here. I, for example, discovered that I was noticeably happier during periods where I spent more time outdoors, meditated more and journal more, and I made changes to my life accordingly. But beyond just emotional states, I found that there is a huge benefit to simply having accurate records of what happened when in your life, you might be surprised to hear that the memory expert doesn't remember exactly what happened on what day of his life. But it's true. Over time, if we do not recall our memories on a regular basis, they can get erased or even altered by creating a permanent physical record of the things you do. You enable yourself to scroll back through an album of your life's events, achievements and experiences. One of my favorite things to do is to read through entries of all trips and relive the excitement and the emotions of those special days in my life. Furthermore, I love to time travel back to the beginnings of relationships or achievements to see how I felt way back then. Imagine the joy of reading your own journal entry of the day. Your child was born at their high school graduation party, or being able to go back in time and tell your spouse the exact day you fell in love with them. The benefits are not all nostalgic, though, as I'm sure you can imagine. Plenty of benefits for being able to remember exactly when you did what and where. At the very least, this type of exercise gives you deep insights into how you've grown as a person and when at the most momentarily reliving each day in order to record it in your journal causes you to slow down, reflect and savor the little moments and occasions that make up your life. And that's as good of a reason as any to actually do it. In fact, of all the daily exercise you're going to learn in this section, this is the one that I almost never skip. It's the first prompt I do in every entry. And if you get into the habit, I think you'll understand why. So how do you do it? Well, there's really not a whole lot to it. *First, you write out what is going on in your life in as much or as little detail as you see fit*. You could list out bullet points of the major events of your week or go into word for word transcripts of conversations you've had. Naturally, the level of detail is also going to be dictated by how frequently you complete this exercise. Personally, I recommend you find a happy medium doing this exercise at least three to four times a week for one to two paragraphs to get your juices flowing. Here are some of the things you might want to write about, *things you're working on, how relationships are going with the people you care about, new or exciting experiences, recent wins or accomplishments, mistakes or missteps, your current emotional state, how you're spending your time, who you're surrounded by, what you're planning for the future*. But ultimately, those are just a handful of suggestions. Like many of the exercises you're going to learn in this course, there isn't a right or wrong way to do this so long as you actually do it. I would, however, *encourage you to pay special attention to things like your emotions, achievements and errors*. How do you feel about the events that are happening in your life right now? What have been your wins lately, where have you made missteps that you hope to learn from in the future? Ultimately, these are going to give you even more value than, matter of fact, bullet points about what happened on each day. By taking an active role in becoming your life's historian, you gain more insight into your life and savor every little morsel in the process. Best of all, it takes very little time at all. Something like five minutes a day. And all the while you're reaping the many benefits, health and otherwise, of journaling as you do it.

*Documenting Lessons Learned*

Now that you understand the many benefits of chronicling your life's events, the next exercise probably won't come as much of a surprise. It's a simple one, but don't let that deceive you. There are a ton of benefits to this quick little routine in this next exercise. All you have to do is this. *Write down what you learned in the last 24 hours. It could be something big, like a lesson you carry with you for the rest of your life or something tiny, like a keyboard shortcut on your computer. It could be one thing or a handful of them. Whatever it is, write it down. Why you ask? Well, there are a number of reasons. First of all, because memory expert or not, like I mentioned before, if you don't review the things you learn, you will forget them. And what is the point of learning something if you're just going to forget it? It would be especially tragic to do so in the case of important life lessons, which, if forgotten, doom you to reliving the same mistakes over and over again*. Writing down the things you've learned then makes it very simple to flip back through your journal and review them for better long term memory. It allows you to keep your learning current and prevents you from forgetting these hard won lessons and learnings. And as I teach in my super learner program, each time you review something you've learned, you push out your forgetting curve, ensuring that you'll remember it longer the next time. But there's more benefit to it than just that you see here. Once again, we gain a secondary benefit in the form of accountability, a word that is going to come up a whole lot throughout this course. I think it's safe to say that anyone taking this course is a passionate, lifelong learner, someone who aspires to learn something new every day. But how often do you actually hold yourself accountable to that value? Fortunately, with this practice, it becomes easy to see how you're doing if you suddenly find that you've gone two weeks without having a learning worth writing about, you know, you need to make a change, swap out the sitcom's for a documentary or pick up a book instead of scrolling through Facebook by having a regular check in with yourself as to what you're actually learning. You create a sort of early warning system that prevents you from ever becoming stagnant. I love this exercise not only because I'm a learning junkie, but also because I'm always amazed at how quickly the things I learn can be pushed to the back of my mind. Sure, I might still remember them, but how often do I actually think about them or utilize them? I remember, for example, flipping through a series of journal entries I wrote on a trip to Japan one year prior and recalling all the fascinating information that I didn't even remember learning about as far as instructions go. This one is pretty easy. Right out. Yesterday I learned or today, if you're journaling at the end of the day and then get to work, you can do bullet points or paragraphs, headlines or detailed explanations. As usual, the particulars are a matter of personal preference. Feel free to try this exercise out the next time you journal. While many of the benefits won't show up until months or years later, when you review, *I think you'll still find there to be a lot of value in the accountability of showing up and reporting that you're still learning every single day*.

*Chronicling Your Dreams*

Over the last couple of lectures, we've talked in various ways about chronicling the day to day happenings of your life, whether that's events, emotions or learnings. But before we move on to a different genre of daily exercises, there's just one more aspect of our daily lives. We've left unrecorded our dreams. To be clear, I'm not talking about our metaphorical dreams, such as aspirations and goals. We'll talk about all those later in a later lecture. No, in this exercise, I'm talking about writing down your literal dreams. You know, the ones that you have at night. Now, some of you might be thinking, who cares? Aren't dreams just nonsense? Our brains make up while we sleep? I know I certainly felt that way once upon a time. That is, until I met Charlie Mallie, world renowned, lucid dreaming expert and all around psychonaut. Charlie taught me that there is significant value to writing down your dreams. And surprisingly, being able to look back and gain insight into your psychological state is actually an afterthought. In reality, the real benefits of writing down your dreams is that it trains your brain to place value on those dreams and to remember them. This is valuable if you're the type of person who wishes to analyze your dreams, share them with someone else, like a therapist or spouse, or just laugh at their absurdity. The vast majority of people forget their dreams during the night or shortly after waking up. But as Charlie taught me, this is a habit that we can change by deliberately writing them down. Over time, your brain will begin to see your dreams as something important and worth remembering, and you'll be able to remember them more vividly. Even if you didn't write them down. From there, you'll reap additional benefits, including being able to lucid dream. For those of you who aren't familiar with lucid dreaming, it's the ability to realize your dreaming and control your own dreams. Much like the movie Inception, you could create crazy, far out experiences such as flying to the moon or meeting your favorite historical figure, or do deeply healing psychological work like mindfulness or talking to your inner child. The possibilities are limitless with lucid dreaming. But first you need to learn how to pay attention and recognize your dreams. For those of you who are curious about dream, recall and lucid dreaming, I'll put a link to Charly's free course in the PDF syllabus. So how do you do it? Well, unlike most of the prompts you'll learn in this course, this one is not the type of prompt or exercise that you do over a cup of coffee in a quiet space in your home. *In fact, as Charlie taught me, if you want to successfully capture your dreams, at least in the beginning, you're going to need to keep your journal by your bedside table, ideally with a little nightlight. When you wake up from a dream immediately scribble it down or at least the basics to be filled in later*. Over time, you will develop the ability to remember your dreams longer. And once you do, you can opt for journaling first thing in the morning when you get out of bed. In fact, this is recommended by a lot of experts for various reasons, but we'll talk about that towards the end of the course. For now, if this is something that you are interested in, I recommend starting small. Try each morning to remember a dream or two and jot down what you remember. If you like this practice and want to go deeper, take your journal into the bedroom with you at night. I'll be honest, though, this might not be of interest to you for a long time. I would chronicle my dreams in minimal detail every morning, and I did notice much more dream clarity and a higher number of lucid dreams. But looking back over time, I haven't found a tremendous amount of value in rereading the dreams that I've written down, which makes this exercise a little bit less valuable to me personally than chronicling my day's events or lessons learned. Either way, I encourage you to experiment with it and feel free to share your results in the course. Discussion. Happy journaling.

*Morning Pages and Getting It All Out*

Now that we've covered the various types of chronicling your life's events and milestones, it's time to transition into some of the more focused types of daily exercises, prompts that serve specific purposes and benefits that are not derived from historical insight. I can think of no better place to start than with the wildly popular morning pages prompt popularized by Julia Cameron in her blockbuster book The Artist's Way. Mourning Pages is an exercise specifically designed to clear out your mind a sort of brain drain and a way to get rid of any negative emotions or bottlenecks that are holding you back. Julia Cameron describes this practice as spiritual windshield wipers that gets rid of all that angry, petty, whiny stuff that eddys through our subconscious and muddies our days. It might sound a little elusive, but you'd be amazed at the roster of people, including personal development guru Tim Ferriss, who swear by morning pages. So how do you do it? Well, I'll let Julia explain in her own words. Morning pages are three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing done first thing in the morning. There is no wrong way to do morning pages. They are not high art. They are not even writing. They are about anything and everything that crosses your mind and they are for your eyes. *Only morning pages provoke, clarify, comfort, cajole, prioritize and synchronize the day at hand. Do not overthink warning pages. Just put three pages of anything on the page and then do three more pages tomorrow*. Yep, you heard that right. No specific topic, no specific purpose, no highfalutin thinking. Just you. A pen and paper for three pages of mental diarrhea. Whatever comes out comes out at its core. Morning pages is just a technique for quieting the chatter, forgiving your mind, an opportunity to let it all out and clean house, squeeze them out, then get on with your day. It can't get any simpler than that. And while research shows that there are a lot of benefits to other types of focused, topic oriented journaling you are learning about in the other lectures of this course, it's hard to argue with the testimonials of many morning pages fans. They claim that this one practice alone has helped them flush out ideas that change their careers, work through issues that have bothered them, get over the types of repetitive thoughts we've discussed earlier and much, much more. For this reason, I recommend giving this exercise a try next time you journal. Technically, it's three full pages, though you can of course, go for less time and mix and match with other exercises. So there you have it. One more tool in your journalling arsenal. Give it a try and let me know in the course discussion what you think.

*Your Daily Why*

All right, we are on a roll now with some really solid daily journaling exercises for you to choose from, and I think you're really going to like this one, too. At the beginning of the course, you might recall that I had you journal freely on exactly why you wanted to pick up journaling. As I explained at the time, having a clear Y in mind not only motivates and aligns you, *but early research by educational psychologist Malcolm Knowles has also shown that the adult brain needs to understand why it is learning or doing something before it can fully engage with the task at hand. This idea, the idea of identifying with your why is a big deal*. Entire books have been written about the power of Y for leading and motivating people towards change. In fact, I bet many of you have seen Simon Cynic's TED Talk, one of the most successful and most watched talks of all time on the subject. The bottom line is this why we do things matters and being cognizant of that why has significant and long lasting effects on our behavior and our psychology. In light of all this, it probably won't come as a surprise to you that our next journal entry has to do with the big question why, like many of the exercises you're learning in this course, it's deceptively simple. And yet I found this, too, to be hugely impactful. Here's the idea. Are you ready to write out your daily? Why? Allow me to elaborate on your journaling sheet. *You simply write out my why for today, Colon*, and proceed to write exactly why you are going to do what you plan to do today. Now, to be clear, this is less an exercise in pressuring yourself into doing the things you aren't actually planning to do or explaining to yourself why you really should go to the gym tonight after work. We'll cover that later on when we talk about journaling your goals. Instead, when I say journal about what you're going to do, I mean, just that. Write out exactly why you're going to spend the day the way you plan to spend it. Here are some examples from my own personal journal. *My why today*, spending time with my family allows me to create cherished memories, grounds me and brings me closer to the people that make me happy in life. My wife today writing new courses provides value to my loyal and respected customers, keeps my business relevant and profitable and challenges me. It also gives my valued superhuman squad members a reason to continue their membership. Or how about this one? My wife today sorting out my tax situation will allow me to go into the New Year and into Christmas vacation with a clear head, less stress, less anxiety and less uncertainty. It seems simple, maybe even obvious, but there's more than meets the eye with this exercise, you see, *when you realign around your Y at the beginning of the day, you create a greater sense of purpose around your activities*, as you probably gathered from my examples above, by aligning with the Y, another run of the mill Saturday with your family in the park takes on an air of significance and meaning that it didn't have before. It's not just a fun Saturday in the park. It's an opportunity to create memories that will last you a lifetime. Similarly, a humdrum meeting with your tax advisor now becomes an opportunity to clear your head and your plate so that you can better enjoy your much needed vacation. You get the idea by channeling your why the activities that make up your life take on a new meaning, and as a result, you may find that you show up in a whole new way. Sure, you might phone it in for just another Saturday at the park, getting distracted by your phone or leaving early. But in the context of that, deeper why you may put in the extra effort, be present and ultimately get much more out of the experience. And that in and of itself is the real benefit of this powerful exercise. What's more like so many exercises in this course, journaling about your daily why can sometimes serve as a very useful filter, a system of checks and balances. After all, we all have days that are throwaways where we can't muster the energy to do much more than watch Netflix or read a book on the couch. But if you find yourself repeatedly having these types of days, pretty sure you run out of ways to justify your behavior or say, for example, that you find yourself struggling to answer the question one morning, why am I going into another day at this job? You might ask yourself or perhaps wait, why am I going to visit this friend who no longer appreciates me in this way by holding ourselves accountable to the why behind our actions, we can force ourselves out of autopilot and stop doing things without a good reason. Ultimately, the only reason to do things in life is because they move you closer towards your goals and aspirations, whether that's the health and happiness of yourself and the people you love, a career you love, or hobbies that bring you joy by journaling about our why we root out self sabotaging behaviors that no longer serve us. When you pair this up with the benefits we mentioned before, including heightened motivation and a greater sense of purpose and reward from the activities you do on a daily basis, I think you'll find that this exercise is one you keep coming back to. Best of all, it takes less than a minute to do. Give it a try this week and let me know in the course discussion what you think.
